# EDA on sales Dataset using Power bi

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
It is an approach for data analysis that employs a variety of techniques (mostly graphical) to

    maximize insight into a data set;
    
    uncover underlying structure;
    
    extract important variables;
    
    detect outliers and anomalies;
    
    test underlying assumptions;
    
    develop parsimonious models; and
    
    determine optimal factor settings.

## Power bi

Microsoft Power BI is a business intelligence (BI) platform that provides nontechnical business users with tools for aggregating, analyzing, visualizing and sharing data. Power BI's user interface is fairly intuitive for users familiar with Excel, and its deep integration with other Microsoft products makes it a versatile self-service tool that requires little upfront training.

Users can download an application for Windows 10, called Power BI Desktop, and native mobile apps for Windows, Android and iOS devices. There is also Power BI Report Server for companies that must maintain their data and reports on premises. That version of Power BI requires a special version of the desktop app -- aptly called Power BI Desktop for Power BI Report Server.

## About Dataset

Sample Sales Data, Order Info, Sales, Customer, Shipping, etc., Used for Segmentation, Customer Analytics, Clustering and More. Inspired for retail analytics. This was originally used for Pentaho DI Kettle, But I found the set could be useful for Sales Simulation training.
